Added Question Details Storage Feature

Enhanced the question details feature to persist explanations in a JSON file:

1. Created question_details.json:
- Empty JSON object that gets populated as details are requested
- Stores explanations keyed by question_id

2. Modified QuestionGenerator:
- Added methods to load and save details from/to question_details.json
- get_question_details now checks for existing details before generating new ones
- New details are automatically saved when generated
- Details are cached to prevent redundant LLM calls

This change ensures that once a detail is generated for a question, it remains consistent and can be quickly retrieved without needing to regenerate it through the LLM.
