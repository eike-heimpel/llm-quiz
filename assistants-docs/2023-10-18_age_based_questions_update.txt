Age-Based Questions System Update

Changes implemented:
1. Updated question model to include age-based categorization (3-9 years and adult)
2. Modified difficulty system to work alongside age categories
3. Updated API endpoints to handle age parameter
4. Enhanced frontend UI with age selection
5. Adjusted LLM integration to consider age when generating questions

File changes:
- backend/models.py: Added Age enum and updated Question model
- backend/llm_integration.py: Modified question generation to include age parameter
- backend/main.py: Updated endpoints to handle age filtering
- backend/questions.json: Reset with new schema
- frontend/src/lib/api.ts: Added Age type and updated interfaces
- frontend/src/routes/+page.svelte: Added age selection UI

The system now supports:
- Age ranges: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 years, and adult
- Each question is tagged with both age and difficulty
- Questions can be filtered by age, difficulty, and category
- LLM context includes age-appropriate content generation

Note: The previous questions.json was cleared to accommodate the new schema. New questions will be generated with age-appropriate content.
