# Functional Instructions for AI Assistant

## Project Overview
This project is an LLM-powered quiz application with the following key functionalities:
1. **Dynamic Question Generation**: Questions are generated by an LLM and grounded in Wikipedia for accuracy.
2. **Scalability**: The system adapts to varying difficulty levels and user needs.
3. **Accessibility**: Includes voice interaction and works for kids who cannot read (via text-to-speech).

The system consists of:
- A **Python FastAPI backend** to handle all core functionalities (question generation, validation, storage, and APIs).
- A **SvelteKit frontend** to implement and deliver the quiz functionality.

## Key Functionalities

### Backend (FastAPI)
1. **LLM Integration**:
   - Use GPT-4o for generating questions.
   - Enforce a response schema with the following fields:
     - `question_id` (unique identifier).
     - `difficulty` (e.g., "easy", "medium", "hard").
     - `category` (e.g., "science", "history").
     - `question_text` (the quiz question text).
     - `correct_answer` (the accurate answer to the question).
     - `incorrect_answers` (a list of plausible, incorrect options).
     - `reference_url` (a valid Wikipedia link for the correct answer).
   - Validate the LLM's response to ensure it adheres to the schema.

2. **APIs**:
   - Provide endpoints for:
     - Generating new questions.
     - Retrieving stored questions with metadata.
     - Submitting and validating answers.
     - Serving text-to-speech output for questions and answers.

3. **Question Storage**:
   - Store generated questions in a structured format (e.g., JSON) with metadata for now.
   - Prepare for possible database integration in the future.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Design a modular architecture to handle future enhancements, such as new categories or difficulty adjustments.

### Frontend (SvelteKit)
1. **Quiz Interface**:
   - Fetch and display questions dynamically from the backend.
   - Enable users to interact with the quiz using mouse and voice input.

2. **Accessibility**:
   - Support non-readers by implementing text-to-speech for questions and answers.

3. **Customization**:
   - Allow users to select difficulty levels and quiz categories.
   - Track progress and provide feedback on answers.

## General Notes for Development
- You will decide on implementation details, but functionalities must align with the outlined requirements.
- The backend should enforce schema validation to ensure consistent data handling.
- The frontend must be responsive and user-friendly, focusing on functionality rather than visuals at this stage.
